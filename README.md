# Learn all the CS things
Proactively filling in the gaps of knowledge I have.

## Topics
Learning centers around the following topics:
- Computability
- Probability & Statistics
- Algorithms & Data Structures

## Current Status
Progress on computability and statistics is a bit stalled due to a lack of understanding of calculus, so this gap is being worked on.

Algorithms and data structures are being addressed through the use of sample problems and the writing of custom basic data structures. This also helps me to better learn Python and C#.
